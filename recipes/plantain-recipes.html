        Plantain porridge is a Nigerian vegetable stew made with the starchy cousin of common bananas. Plantains are
        simmered until tender in a flavorful broth along with assorted vegetables and sometimes fish, beans or meat.

        There is no one recipe for this nutritious dish. Versions of plantain porridge vary widely from region to region
        and household to household. Adjust ingredient amounts according to your taste.
