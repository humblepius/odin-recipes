    <p>Egg sauce is just one of the many egg recipes existing in Nigeria. Now that I think about it,<br>
        I just realized that eggs are actually very common in Nigeria. I use it for making bread, cakes,<br>
        and virtually every snack in Nigeria.
        Here, however, we are going to be making a delicious sauce by combining eggs and several other <br>ingredients.

        I made egg Sauce with eggs, tomatoes, peppers, onions, vegetable oil and a pinch of natural <br>sweetener
        (seasoning cubes.)

        Some people chose to add a handful of vegetables and fluted pumpkin (ugu) is always the most popular<br> choice.
        In
        this recipe, I used a few slices of green pepper instead.

        I usually serve this Sauce in Nigeria with<br> yam as you can see below. That is why it's sometimes called yam
        sauce. I seldom see people serve with rice. It happens though, but rarely. The sauce is delicious however you
        want to use it.

        <li>Set your frying pan on the heat and add just 200ml of oil (vegetable or olive oil), allow one minute before<br>
            adding the sliced tomatoes/onions/peppers. It is best if you have a non-stick frying pan.<br>

            Allow this to fry for 10-15 minutes. Remember to always stir, you don't want to end up with burnt tomatoes.<br>
